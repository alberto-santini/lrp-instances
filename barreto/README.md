## Notes

Originally, the Barreto set contained 18 instances.
Of these, only 13 are typically used in the literature to perform computational experiments.
Prodhon et al. have shared these 13 instances, and they have converted them in the same format as the [prins](../prins/) and [tuzun](../tuzun/) instances.
