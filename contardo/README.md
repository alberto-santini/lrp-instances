## Original paper citation

These instances were first introduced in the following paper.

```bib
@article{Contardo,
  author = {Contardo, Claudio and Hemmelmayr, Vera and Crainic, Teodor Gabriel},
  year = 2012,
  title = {Lower and upper bounds for the two-echelon capacitated location-routing problem},
  doi = {10.1016/j.cor.2012.04.003},
  issue = 12,
  journal = {Computers \& Operations Research},
  pages = {3185--3199},
  volume = 39,
}
```

The instances were created by Contardo et al. using the generation method first introduced in the following paper.
The original instance sets discussed in this paper became unavailable and Contardo generated the new sets provided in this repository.
Therefore, the results presented in the following paper are not comparable with those obtained solving the instances in this repository.

```bib
