First #C lines are for customers, indicating: Node no, X coord, Y coord, Demand
Lines #C + 1 until #C + #S are for satellites, indicating: Node no. X coord, Y coord, Fixed Cost, Capacity
Lines #C + #S + 1 until #C + #S + #P are for platforms, indicating: Node no. X coord, Y coord, Fixed Cost, Capacity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legend:
#C: number of customers
#S: number of satellites
#P: number of platforms
Q2: vehicle capacity at second echelon
Q1: vehicle capacity at first echelon
CPV2: Fixed cost per vehicle at second echelon
CPV1: Fixed cost per vehicle at first echelon
VC: variable cost per unit of served demand
LB: lower bound of the problem instance
UB: upper bound of the problem instance
CN: costs nature, computed as follows: 0 = euclidean distance, 1 = ceil(euclidean distance), 2 = round(euclidean distance)
CF: traveling cost factor. Traveling costs at first echelon are computed as CF * cost (the cost being computed according to the corresponding cost nature).
